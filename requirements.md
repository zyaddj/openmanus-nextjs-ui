# OpenManus UI Requirements

## Overview
Based on the analysis of the OpenManus GitHub repository, we need to create a user-friendly web interface that makes OpenManus accessible to non-technical users while retaining its full functionality.

## OpenManus Analysis Summary
- OpenManus is an open-source AI agent framework similar to Manus but without requiring an invite code
- It requires configuration for LLM APIs (primarily OpenAI's GPT-4o) through a config.toml file
- Configuration includes API keys, base URLs, model settings, and other parameters
- The main entry point is through `python main.py` where users input their ideas via terminal
- There's also an unstable version accessible via `python run_flow.py`

## Key Configuration Requirements
- LLM model selection (default: gpt-4o)
- API base URL (default: https://api.openai.com/v1)
- API key management
- Model parameters:
  - max_tokens (default: 4096)
  - temperature (default: 0.0)
- Support for multiple LLM models including vision models

## Required Dependencies for Our UI
1. **Frontend Framework**:
   - Next.js (React framework)
   - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
   - React hooks for state management

2. **Authentication & Database**:
   - Supabase for user authentication
   - Supabase for secure API key storage

3. **UI Components**:
   - Text editor component for user prompts
   - Code syntax highlighting for code execution window
   - Form components for API key management
   - Dropdown components for model selection

4. **API Integration**:
   - HTTP client for communicating with OpenManus
   - WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time responses

5. **Deployment**:
   - Vercel for frontend hosting
   - Environment variables management for secure configuration

## UI Features to Implement
1. User authentication system
2. Dashboard with sidebar navigation
3. API key management interface
4. Model selection dropdown
5. Text editor for user prompts
6. Real-time response display
7. Code execution window
8. Export functionality (JSON, Markdown, text)
9. Settings and customization options
10. Dark/light mode toggle
